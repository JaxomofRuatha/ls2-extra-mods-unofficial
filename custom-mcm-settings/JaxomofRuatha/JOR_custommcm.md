# Living Skyrim MCM Configuration 
To play Living Skyrim as intended, the MCM and Skyrim in-game settings should be set as follows. These aren’t strictly required but are a good baseline to tweak from.

* Settings
    - Depth of Field: Minimum/Off

* Ava
  * The first thing that will happen is you'll be prompted to select your attributes using SkyRem AVA. This allows you to design your character for a specific build right from the beginning of the game. Assign your points carefully, as this choice is permanent and cannot be changed after completion!
    * Note: you can now choose to defer this, I usually make a save after setting up the rest of the MCM before actually assigning attribute points

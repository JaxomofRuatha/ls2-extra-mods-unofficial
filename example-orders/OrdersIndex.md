# Example Install/Load Orders

If you're not aware, with the `modlist.txt` files, MO2 lists them backwards for some reason, so the last mod in the file is the first mod in your modlist. Lines starting with `-` are disabled mods, and ones starting with `+` are enabled.

Note for this version, I re-ran xLODGen Terrain, DynDOLOD, and Occlusion (and therefore not using the various custom patches that were fixed in relation to those)

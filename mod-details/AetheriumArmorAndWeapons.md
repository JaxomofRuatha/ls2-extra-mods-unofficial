## Aetherium Armor and Weapons Compilation by Lautasantenni

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2687

**Summary:** Adds 2 Power Armor Sets and many weapons after unlocking the Aetherium Forge. Can be displayed at the museum using
the LOTD patch.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no known stability issues with or without the LOTD patch)

**Recommendations:** 
* WinterdrakeX (Highly Recommend)

**Official Patches:**
* [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980)
* [The Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529)
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31416 (patch for respawnable aetherium ore, also grab the shield mesh fix if you need it)
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24094 (shiny-bright better armor textures)

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**CLEANING REQUIRED:**
* AetheriumSwordsnArmor.esp

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.4.0)
  * AetheriumSwordsnArmor.esp and Aetherium Ore Respawns.esp, in that order, are currently before Audio Overhaul Skyrim.esp
  * Aetherium Shield Menu Mesh Fix and Aetherium Armor Texture Enhancements installed anywhere after the main Aetherium Armor and Weapons Compilation mod
  * DBM_AetheriumWeapons_Patch.esp and LOTD_TCC_Aetherium.esp in that order, currently before ELE_SSE.esp (NOTE: I reinstalled the Legacy of the Dragonborn Official Patches and Legacy of the Dragonborn SSE - The Curators Companion with different names and no other patches enabled to get these)
* WinterdrakeX (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * AetheriumSwordsnArmor.esp must be loaded before ELE_SSE.esp
  * DBM_AetheriumWeapons_Patch.esp loaded before Bashed Patch, 0.esp (NOTE: I reinstalled the Legacy of the Dragonborn Official Patches with a different name and no other patches enabled to get this)
  * Aetherium Ore Respawns.esp immediately after AetheriumSwordsnArmor.esp ; Aetherium Shield Menu Mesh Fix and Texture Enhancements anywhere after AetheriumArmornWeapons mod.

**Extra Notes:**
* Highly preferred to be installed only if Aetherium Forge quest was still not started (new  game obviously preferred), since you could only find aetherium ingots on certain Dwemer ruins.
* Finish the vanilla quests "Lost to the Ages" and "Unfathomable Depths" in order to unlock the Recipes. Can only be crafted using the Aetherium Forge.

**Summary:** A project to overhaul the children from RS Children Overhaul to make them look more realistic, unique and lore-friendly. 

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no stability or black face issues found after patching)

**Recommendations:**
* @KNGLogan (Must-Add)
* @JaxomofRuatha (Must-Add)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.0, 2.5.2)
  * `RSkyrimChildren.esm` is currently after `More Gifts For Children.esl`
  * All remaining plugins are loaded after `LS2 Patches Merged.esp`, with `RSChildren.esp` first, then all patches from the "RS Children Patch Compendium", then `RealisticRSChildren.esp`, and finally the RRSC patches.

**Extra Notes:**

The only plugin I was unable to ESL flag was the `RSkyrimChildren.esm` one, so altogether this should only take up that one plugin slot.

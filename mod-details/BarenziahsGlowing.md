**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Excellent (no issues, no patching required)

**Recommendations:** 
* JaxomofRuatha (Highly Recommend)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.2.1, 2.4.0, 2.5.2)
  * Mod files go anywhere after "Gameplay Merged", "Barenziah's Glory SE" first, then overwritten by "Barenziah's Glowing SE"
  * I personally used the red default texture in the FOMOD

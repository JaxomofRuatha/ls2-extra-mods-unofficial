## Nordic Snow (aka HQ Snow Texture)

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/670

**Summary:** I think the vanilla snow texture is really bad, so i made this one. I was hoping to get a more crystallized look on the snow and make it feel more cold.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no issues known after patching)

**Recommendations:** 
* chosti-factor (Highly Recommend)
  * My personal snow mod favorite.

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
[Chosti - Nordic Snow / Blended Roads Patch](/custom-patches/Nordic.Snow.Blended.Roads.Redone.Patch.zip)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* chosti-factor (LS2 version 2.5.0)
  * "Nordic Snow (aka HQ Snow Texture)" is just after "Hyperborean Snow" in MO2's left pane. I disabled Hyperborean snow. custom Blended Roads patch is after Nordic Snow wherever.

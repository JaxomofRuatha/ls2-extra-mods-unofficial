## Volkihar Knight - Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38546

**Summary:** Adds a small display to LOTD's Hall of Secrets to house a set of the Volkihar Knight armor. 

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Unclear (no known issues, but since Volkihar Knight.esp is currently in Armors Merged.esp, I currently have just made a dummy plugin, but feel COMPLETELY FREE to skip this mod until it is properly integrated into LS)

**Recommendations:** 
_None_

**Official Patches:**
* [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980)
* [The Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529)

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**Dummy Patches:**
* Volkihar Knight.esp

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.4.0, 2.5.2)
  * Place `Volkihar Knight.esp` dummy plugin before `Audio Overhaul Skyrim.esp`.
  * `DBM_VolkiharKnight_Patch.esp` and `LOTD_TCC_Volkihar.esp` in that order, currently before `ELE_SSE.esp` (NOTE: I reinstalled the "Legacy of the Dragonborn Official Patches" and "Legacy of the Dragonborn SSE - The Curators Companion" with different names and no other patches enabled to get these)

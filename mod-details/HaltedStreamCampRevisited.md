**Summary:** Reworks the interior of Halted Stream Camp

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** No conflicts, but comments on the mod indicate there might be a consistency issue with the Halted Stream Mine mod (didn't cause instability issue for me, but may cause issues once the camp is "conquered" and initiates the Halted Stream Mine mod features)

* JaxomofRuatha (Highly Recommend)

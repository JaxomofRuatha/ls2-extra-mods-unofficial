**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22513 (Faction - Pit Fighter, Faction - Pit Figher Travels Add-on)

**Summary:** Pit Fighter contains an all new faction to join, complete with NPCs, progression through the ranks, unique rewards and side quests.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no stability issues known, tested by @chosti-factor with LS 2.4.0)

**Recommendations:** 
* @chosti-factor (Okay)
  * Fun mod, battles with a wide range of character levels, good voice acting overall, and variety of setting for battles makes it worth the install.

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
* [Chosti - Pit Fighter / USSEP Patch](/custom-patches/Pit%20Fighter%20Patch.esp)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* @chosti-factor (LS2 version 2.4.0), JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.0)
  * Load `quest_pitfighter.esp`, `quest_pitfighter_dlc01.esp`, and `Pit Fighter Patch.esp`, in that order, before `Clockwork.esp` (and `Keld-Nar.esp` if you have it). I have the three loaded immediately before `JKs Skyrim.esp`.

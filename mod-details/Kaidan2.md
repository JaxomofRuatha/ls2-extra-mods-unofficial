## Kaidan 2

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075

**Summary:** Rebuilt and expanded, this romantic follower features over 1200 lines of dialogue, custom home, and mini quests. 

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no known issues after patching, need to deactivate camp to use with Blackthorn Manor)

**Recommendations:** 
_None_

**Official Patches:**
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23738 (Pandorable's Kaidan SE)

**Custom Patches:**
* [JOR - Kaidan 2 / USSEP Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_Kaidan_USSEP_Patch.esp)
* [JOR - Kaidan 2 / Occlusion Patch](/custom-patches/2.5.2/JOR_Kaidan_OcclusionLS2.5.2_Patch.esp)
* [JOR - Kaidan 2 / LOTD Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_Kaidan_LOTD_Patch.esp) (This isn't strictly necessary, but forwards changes from Kaidan making "The Lusty Argonian Maid" a skill book for One-Handed :laughing:)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.2)
  * Make sure to unpack the BSA for "Kaidan 2" when installing. "Pandorable's Kaidan" should be installed after the main "Kaidan 2" mod. Install both BEFORE "unofficial performance optimized textures AKA (UPOT)"
  * Load `0Kaidan.esp` before `BlackthornManor.esp`
  * Load `JOR_Kaidan_USSEP_Patch.esp` and `JOR_Kaidan_LOTD_Patch.esp` after `zPatch.esp`, and `JOR_Kaidan_OcclusionLS2.5.2_Patch.esp` after `Occlusion.esp`

**Extra Notes:**

Unless you plan on removing "Blackthorn - A Buildable Town in The Rift (SE)" (not recommended for LS2), you NEED to disable the camp this mod adds. To do this, use the "Summon Kaidan" ability while sneaking, and in the menu this brings up, disable the Myriah camp.

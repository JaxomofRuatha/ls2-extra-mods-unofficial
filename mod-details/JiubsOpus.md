## Jiub's Opus

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17056

**Summary:** Simple mod that adds quest markers for the side quest "Impatience of a Saint".

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Excellent (no issues, no patching required)

**Recommendations:** 
* WinterdrakeX (Highly Recommend)

**Official Patches:**
_None_

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.4.0, 2.5.2)
  * Currently after `Occlusion.esp` in load order
* WinterdrakeX (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * Install anywhere after `Occlusion.esp`

**Extra Notes:**
* Don't go wandering off in the Soul Cairn for eternity just for a small quest. ESL flagged!
* The comments for this mod mention "Quest Markers Restored" as an alternative that adds markers to other quests as well, but there are severe conflicts with that mod in SSEEdit. It may make sense to use that if it can be patched, but this is a lightweight version that only adds the markers for the one quest.

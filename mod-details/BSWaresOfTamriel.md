  * Install "Beyond Skyrim - Wares of Tamriel SE" mod after "Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE" and before "Darkend"
  * Currently I have `BeyondSkyrimMerchant.esp` and `JK's Skyrim + Beyond Skyrim Wares - Patch.esp` loaded before `ELE_SSE.esp`

**Extra Notes:**

The patch `JK's Skyrim + Beyond Skyrim Wares - Patch.esp` should be safe to ESL flag if you need the space, there's just one extra step that needs to be done:

* Load your full list of mods in SSEEdit, right click on the patch, and select "Compact FormIDs for ESL" from the menu. After this operation completes, you should be able to add an ESL flag to the plugin as usual.

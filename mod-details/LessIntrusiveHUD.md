## Less Intrusive HUD II SE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17974 (Less Intrusive HUD II SE 1.1.44-SE, Less Intrusive HUD II SE - FISSES Patch -towatot)

**Summary:** Less Intrusive HUD II allows you to tweak / change pretty much every element in the vanilla HUD. And it does so : IN GAME ! No seperate .txt files, no more going in/out game to check your setting.

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no issues, no patching required)

**Recommendations:** 
* JaxomofRuatha (Highly Recommend)

**Official Patches:**
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39886 (Optional if you have Pastel Map Markers)

**Custom Patches:**
_None_

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.2)
  * Install "Less Intrusive HUD II SE" and "Less Intrusive HUD II SE - FISSES Patch -towatot" (I have them as separate mods but shouldn't be a problem to Merge instead) in that order after "SkyHUD" and "HUD Merged" if you went that route.
  * Install "Pastel Compass Map Markers for Less Intrusive HUD II" after both main mod files if you're choosing to use it.

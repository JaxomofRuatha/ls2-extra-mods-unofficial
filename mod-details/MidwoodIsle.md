## Midwood Isle SE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120

**Summary:** New land mod with multiple quests

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no serious issues after patch, a few textures with serious lag and some that seemed to be missing entirely, may just need better patching or CK attention)

**Recommendations:**

* JaxomofRuatha (Okay)
  * The mod itself is incredibly well done for the most part, with the exception of a few iffy voice acting parts, but it feels extremely "vanilla" in a not great way. I definitely wouldn't do the full exploration again, though the main quest is decent (again, feels very "vanilla" Elder Scrolls)

**Official Patches:**
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120 (CBBE Plated Robes, Dangerous NPCs Patch, Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch, Lights control by Tarlazo, Solitude ship alternative location 2 patch)

**Custom Patches:**
* [JOR - Midwood Isle SE / USSEP Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_MidwoodIsle_USSEP_Patch.esp)
* [JOR - Midwood Isle Alternate Ship Location 2 / Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_MidwoodIsleAltShip2_LegacyOfTheDragonborn_Patch.esp)

**CLEANING REQUIRED:**
* `Midwood Isle.esp`

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.4.0, 2.5.2)
  * Install "Midwood Isle SE" before all of: "Beyond Reach", "Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE", and "Darkend"
  * `Midwood Isle.esp` should be loaded before `arnima.esm`, all BS Bruma plugins, and `LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm`
  * `MI Alt Ship Loc 2.esp` should be loaded as high as possible, I currently have it immediately after `Campfire.esm`
  * `Dangerous NPCs MI Patch.esp` and `MILightsControl.esp` are likely okay anywhere, currently after `Occlusion.esp`
  * Currently `JOR_MidwoodIsle_USSEP_Patch.esp` is loaded after `Palaces Castles Enhanced.esp` and `JOR_MidwoodIsleAltShip2_LegacyOfTheDragonborn_Patch.esp` is loaded after `LS2 Patches Merged.esp`
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * Currently `Midwood Isle.esp` and `MI Alt Ship Loc 2.esp` are before `SkyUI_SE.esp`
  * `DBM_MidwoodIsle_Patch.esp` is before `ai overhaul patch.esp`
  * `Dangerous NPCs MI Patch.esp` and `MILightsControl.esp` are likely okay anywhere, currently after `Occlusion.esp`

**Extra Notes:**

I would also recommend running Cathedral Assets Optimizer on this mod, unsure if it helps to a large degree but it did process a lot of assets successfully (and in-game previously I had significant framerate drops with the custom textures/meshes)

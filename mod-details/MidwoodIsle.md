## Midwood Isle SE

**Link:** https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120

**Summary:** New land mod with multiple quests

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no serious issues after patch, a few textures with serious lag and some that seemed to be missing entirely, may just need better patching or CK attention)

**Recommendations:**

* JaxomofRuatha (Okay)
  * The mod itself is incredibly well done for the most part, with the exception of a few iffy voice acting parts, but it feels extremely "vanilla" in a not great way. I definitely wouldn't do the full exploration again, though the main quest is decent (again, feels very "vanilla" Elder Scrolls)

**Official Patches:**
* https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120 (CBBE Plated Robes, Dangerous NPCs Patch, Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch, Lights control by Tarlazo, Solitude ship alternative location 2 patch)

**Custom Patches:**
* [JOR - Midwood Isle SE / USSEP Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_MidwoodIsle_USSEP_Patch.esp)
* [JOR - Midwood Isle Alternate Ship Location 2 / Legacy of the Dragonborn Patch](/custom-patches/JOR_MidwoodIsleAltShip2_LegacyOfTheDragonborn_Patch.esp)

**CLEANING REQUIRED:**
* Midwood Isle.esp

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.4.0)
  * Install Midwood Isle SE before all of: Beyond Reach, Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE, and Darkend
  * Midwood Isle.esp should be loaded before arnima.esm, all BS Bruma plugins, and LegacyoftheDragonborn.esm
  * MI Alt Ship Loc 2.esp should be loaded as high as possible, I currently have it immediately after Campfire.esm
  * Dangerous NPCs MI Patch.esp and MILightsControl.esp are likely okay anywhere, currently after Occlusion.esp
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.2.1)
  * Currently Midwood Isle.esp and MI Alt Ship Loc 2.esp are before SkyUI_SE.esp
  * DBM_MidwoodIsle_Patch.esp is before ai overhaul patch.esp
  * Dangerous NPCs MI Patch.esp and MILightsControl.esp are likely okay anywhere, currently after Occlusion.esp

**Extra Notes:**

I would also recommend running Cathedral Assets Optimizer on this mod, unsure if it helps to a large degree but it did process a lot of assets successfully (and in-game previously I had significant framerate drops with the custom textures/meshes)

## Enigma Series SSE / Talkative Dragons

**NOTE:** Talkative Dragons has been added to LS as of 2.4.0, so only Enigma Series and its patches need to be added if you are using this version or afterward (assuming it's kept in post-2.4.0)

**Summary:** Changes many dragons' speaking voices to be more inhuman and intimidating, and uses vanilla voice lines to have normal dragons speak in combat

**LS2 Compatibility Status:** Good (no stability issues known after patching)

* JaxomofRuatha (Highly Recommend)

**Load/Install Order Notes:**
* JaxomofRuatha (LS2 version 2.5.0, 2.5.2)
  * `FleshFX.esp` is currently before `Bashed Patch, 0.esp` (definitely needs to be before `LS2 Patches Merged`)

**Extra Notes:**

Tired of the mega-glowy flesh armor spells? Don't attract attention while sneaking! Use FleshFX. It will only place the effects on your skin, not your armor. Plus, the effects are very cool.
